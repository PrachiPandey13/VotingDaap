Project Overview
This dApp leverages Ethereum smart contracts to manage data and interaction, allowing for decentralized operations. Users interact with the app through a user-friendly React frontend, which connects to Ethereum smart contracts deployed on a compatible network (e.g., the Volta testnet).

Features
Voting Contract: A Solidity smart contract enabling a voting mechanism.
Frontend: A React-based user interface to interact with the smart contract.
Testing: Full testing of the smart contract functionality using Hardhat and Chai.
