Project Name
This project is a full-stack dApp (decentralized application) that uses React for the frontend and Solidity smart contracts deployed with Hardhat for the backend. It includes testing, deployment configurations, and environment setups.




Features
Voting Contract: A Solidity smart contract enabling a voting mechanism.
Frontend: A React-based user interface to interact with the smart contract.
Testing: Full testing of the smart contract functionality using Hardhat and Chai.




Installation & Setup
1) Prerequisites: Ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (>=14.x)
MetaMask (or another Ethereum wallet)
Infura/Alchemy API Key (for network access)

2) Environment Setup:

Create a .env file in the root directory with the following:
API_URL="https://volta-rpc.energyweb.org"  # Replace with your RPC URL
PRIVATE_KEY="your_private_key_here"         # Replace with your Ethereum wallet private key

3) Install Dependencies: Run the following command to install all necessary packages:
npm install


Running the Project
1) Deploying the Smart Contract: To deploy the contract on the chosen network (e.g., Volta testnet), run:
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network volta


2) Starting the React App: To start the frontend, run:
   npm start
   Visit http://localhost:3000 to interact with the app.




   Testing
To test the smart contract functionality, run: npx hardhat test.
This will execute the tests in the test/lock.js file.


This will execute the tests in the test/lock.js file.
