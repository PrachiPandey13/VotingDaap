Project Overview
This dApp leverages Ethereum smart contracts to manage data and interaction, allowing for decentralized operations. Users interact with the app through a user-friendly React frontend, which connects to Ethereum smart contracts deployed on a compatible network (e.g., the Volta testnet).

Features
Voting Contract: A Solidity smart contract enabling a voting mechanism.
Frontend: A React-based user interface to interact with the smart contract.
Testing: Full testing of the smart contract functionality using Hardhat and Chai.
Installation
Prerequisites
Node.js (>=14.x) and npm
Hardhat (automatically installed via npm dependencies)
Ethereum Wallet: Install MetaMask or another Web3-compatible wallet.
Infura/Alchemy API Key for network access (use environment variables).
Steps
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/project-name.git
cd project-name
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Configuration
Environment Variables: Create a .env file in the root directory with the following:

bash
Copy code
API_URL="https://volta-rpc.energyweb.org"  # Replace with your network's RPC URL
PRIVATE_KEY="your_private_key_here"         # Replace with your Ethereum wallet private key
Hardhat Configuration: Ensure hardhat.config.js has your chosen network setup. This project is configured for the Volta testnet.

Running the Project
Deploying Contracts
To deploy the smart contract, use Hardhat:

bash
Copy code
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network volta
Starting the React Frontend
Run the following command to start the React app:
bash
Copy code
npm start
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to interact with the dApp.
Testing
The project includes tests for the smart contract, written with Chai and Mocha. To run tests, use:

bash
Copy code
npx hardhat test
This will execute the tests in test/lock.js and report the results in the console.
